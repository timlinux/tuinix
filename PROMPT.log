PROMPT LOG - nixmywindows Repository
================================================================================
Date: 2025-12-03
Session: Initial Repository Setup

Prompt:
I want to turn this into a Git repo.
I would like a .github folder with README.md and assets/ for documentation (and add further docs there in a well organised manner as needed)
Maintain a file in the root of this folder called PROMPT.log into which you should write a comprehensive log of every prompt I give you.
Add all the niceties of a very well organised github repo, with things like package builds, testing in CI, templates for issues and PRs, a CLA agreement, badges on the readme showing project health and any other additions that the very nicest of git repositories have.
When you are ready, make the initial commit in the local git repo and then push this to a new repo under timlinux/nixmywindows and make sire gh command line client is optimally set up to work in this repo.
Leave claude directives and configurations in this folder to make future sessions with Claude productive and consistent.

Action Taken:
- Initialized Git repository
- Created PROMPT.log file for tracking all prompts
- Planning to create comprehensive GitHub repository structure with:
  - .github folder with workflows, templates, and documentation
  - CI/CD pipelines for testing and builds
  - Issue and PR templates
  - CLA agreement
  - Professional README.md with badges
  - Standard repository files (LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
  - Claude configuration files for future sessions
  - Initial commit and GitHub repository creation

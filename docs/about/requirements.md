# Project Requirements

This project seeks to create a usable, user-friendly, terminal-centric Linux experience, based on NixOS.

Born from the vision of combining the power of NixOS with the
elegance of terminal-based computing, tuinix represents a return
to the essence of what makes Linux powerful -- direct, efficient,
and completely under your control.

## Core features

1. Based on NixOS and Nix Flakes
2. ZFS with encryption as the underlying filesystem
3. Terminal only -- no Wayland or X11
